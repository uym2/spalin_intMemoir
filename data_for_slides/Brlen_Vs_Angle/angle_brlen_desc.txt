combined angles of the ground truth data

angles are defined as the angle ABC, where A,C = child nodes, B = parent node, for every parent node with two children nodes.

for each angle ABC, annotate with the "branch length" defined as (A.edge_length + C.edge_length) / 2

i.e the average of the branch lengths between the child nodes and the parent node.
