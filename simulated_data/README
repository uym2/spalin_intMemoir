A semi-simulated data. True trees and locations are obtained from intMemoir; only use trees that have 10 or more leaves (70/106 of the intMemoir data)
Sequences are simulated using Problin
* Number of sites (k): 10
* Alphabet for each site: [1,2]
* Mutation rate: 0.006 (expected number of mutations per time frame; estimated from the LT data of intMemoir)
* No missing data (phi = nu = 0)
* Number of replicates: 5 for each tree
