combined angles of the ground truth data

angles are defined as the angle ABC, where A,C = child nodes, B = parent node, for every parent node with two children nodes.

for each angle ABC, annotate with the "distance to root" which is defined as the sum of all edges when traversing from parent node B to the root.
