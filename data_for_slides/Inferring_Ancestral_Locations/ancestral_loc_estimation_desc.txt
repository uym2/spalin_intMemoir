for brlens generated by a varierty of methods, estimate the ancestral locations using gaussian_locations in estimate.py

calculate the euclidean distance against the true ancestral locations

true = true brlens, true tree topology
problin = brlens calculated by problin given true tree topology
spalin = brlens calculated by spalin given true tree topology
unit = all brlens = 1, true tree topology
random = all brlens calculated from random(1, max(true_tree_brlens)), given true tree topologt
gaussian = ignore tree topology, ancestral locations calculated by taking N(mean, var), where (mean,var) determined only from true leaf locations for each tree
